        "designSummary": "This brand design features a modern, minimalistic aesthetic with a strong emphasis on grid-based structure and high contrast. The primary colors are black and white, providing a clean and professional backdrop, while vibrant orange and soft lavender gradients serve as accent colors to highlight key interactive elements and create visual interest. Typography is monospaced and typewriter-inspired, reinforcing a technical and coding-related theme. The layout is modular and asymmetrical, using clear columns and rows with visible grid lines to evoke a sense of precision and order. UI components such as buttons are sharp-edged and functional, primarily using the 'secondary' orange color for calls to action. The overall visual personality is futuristic, energetic, and tech-savvy, suitable for technology conferences or digital product showcases.",

The 'brandAccent' peach is utilized for variety in card backgrounds or illustrative elements, best paired with black text.

The 'secondary' color has been calibrated to meet WCAG AA standards (~4.5:1) when paired with 'secondaryForeground' (white).

    "designSummary": "This brand design features a modern, minimalistic aesthetic with a strong emphasis on grid-based structure and high contrast. The primary colors are black and white, providing a clean and professional backdrop, while vibrant orange and soft lavender gradients serve as accent colors to highlight key interactive elements and create visual interest. Typography is monospaced and typewriter-inspired, reinforcing a technical and coding-related theme. The layout is modular and asymmetrical, using clear columns and rows with visible grid lines to evoke a sense of precision and order. UI components such as buttons are sharp-edged and functional, primarily using the 'secondary' orange color for calls to action. The overall visual personality is futuristic, energetic, and tech-savvy, suitable for technology conferences or digital product showcases.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' black color predominantly for backgrounds and large text blocks to create strong contrast with the 'primaryForeground' white text. The 'secondary' orange color is reserved for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and interactive elements, paired with 'secondaryForeground' black text for readability. The 'lavenderGradientStart' and 'lavenderGradientEnd' colors form a smooth gradient used in large background blocks and overlays to add a modern, digital feel without overwhelming the design. The 'gridLine' color is used subtly for background grid lines to reinforce the structured, technical aesthetic. These colors should be combined thoughtfully to maintain accessibility and visual hierarchy, ensuring that text and interactive elements stand out clearly against their backgrounds.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' white text on 'primary' black background meets WCAG AAA contrast standards for all text sizes. The 'secondaryForeground' black text on 'secondary' orange background meets WCAG AA standards for normal text and AAA for large text. The lavender gradient colors provide sufficient contrast when used with black text for headings and body copy. The 'gridLine' color is light and used only for non-interactive background elements, ensuring no accessibility issues."
